<!-- ### Introduction to Ptychography -->


#### What is ptychography?
Ptychography is a microscopy technique that recovers a image from multiple overlapping diffraction patterns. It aims to solve the [phase problem](#the-phase-problem) for the detections, then backpropagate to reconstruct the exit wave at the specimen.

#### Notation

Sample &approx; exit wave &approx; real space &rarr; $\psi(\mathbf{r})$

#### The phase problem
Usually, an image records the intensities $I = |\psi|^2$ of a wave, discarding its phase.
